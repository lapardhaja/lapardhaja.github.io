# Dr. Servet Lapardhaja - Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This site showcases my journey as a Transportation Engineer, from my academic foundations at UC Berkeley to my professional work.

## About Me

I'm a Transportation Engineer with expertise in traffic modeling, data science, and the impacts of emerging technologies on urban mobility. My Ph.D. research at UC Berkeley focused on how Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) affects urban congestion - a topic I'm passionate about exploring further as these technologies become more prevalent.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as a comprehensive showcase of my:
- Professional experience at HNTB and other organizations
- Academic background, including my Ph.D. research
- Publications in transportation engineering and related fields
- Technical skills in programming, simulation, and analysis
- Awards and recognitions

## Key Features
